# Dicee 🎲

## Goal

The objective of this tutorial was to be introduced to the core programming concepts that form the foundation of most of the apps you’ll build in the future. This app taught me how to make apps with functionality using setState() inside Stateful Flutter widgets.


## What I have created

A basic Dice app using Flutter that changes the two dice faces randomly whenever one of them is clicked (tapped).
